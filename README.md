# Python ON Page SEO Analyzer 

This CLI (Command Line Interface) based program will analyze how well a webpage content is optimized for a keyword.

    
NOTE: This is just a program which runs on certain logic/algorithm, it nowhere indicates you will start ranking on SERPs if it shows all green, or you will not rank at all if it shows red. Rather it just gives you hints what further can be optimized. Manual audit is recommended.
